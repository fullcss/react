### The most basic component

JSXCSS's All layout components ([Flex](/docs/emotion/src/layout-components/Flex.i18n), [Stack](/docs/emotion/src/layout-components/Stack.i18n)) extend Box.
Therefore, you need to know Box first to use other layout components well.

## 1. css prop

JSXCSS allows direct use of css props within jsx.

### concise style code

This minimizes the number of lines of code and increases readability.

```tsx
// verbose
import { css } from '@emotion/react'

const Verbose = () => (
  <div
    css={css`
      width: 18px;
    `}
  />
)

// concise
import { Box } from '@jsxcss/emotion'

const Concise = () => <Box width={18} />
```

### Easy Responsive UI implementation

As you can see in the example below, the previous css approach requires you to write verbose code to write media queries.
Also, even though most components have the same breakpoint, you had to write how many px the style diverged each time.

On the other hand, with JSXCSS's responsive css prop, developers simply add that property to the breakpoint's index.
This makes your code much more concise and easier to maintain.

> To use this feature, you need to parent the [MediaQueryProvider](/docs/emotion/src/responsive/MediaQueryProvider.i18n) of JSXCSS to have the px of that breakpoint.

```tsx
// verbose
import { css } from '@emotion/react'

const Verbose = () => (
  <div
    css={css`
      width: 18px;
      background-color: red;

      @media (min-width: 768px) {
        font-size: 24px;
        background-color: orange;
      }
      @media (min-width: 1440px) {
        font-size: 36px;
        background-color: green;
      }
    `}
  />
)

// concise
import { Box } from '@jsxcss/emotion'

const Concise = () => (
  <Box
    width={[18, 24, 36]} // breakpoints was provided in parent component, MediaQueryProvider
    backgroundColor={['red', 'orange', 'green']}
  />
)
```

## 2. as prop

Box returns as a div by default.

### Accessibility support

However, you can always convert it to another ReactElement if you wish.

```tsx
// Accessible
const Correct = () => <Box as="section" />
```

### Type safety

You can freely change the tag while also being guaranteed stability in terms of type.

```tsx
// Wrong
const Wrong = () => (
  <Box
    as="div"
    href="https://example.com" // type error occured! because of as prop, div tag have no href prop
  />
)

// Correct
const Correct = () => (
  <Box
    as="a"
    href="https://example.com" // Good, because of as prop, a tag
  />
)
```
