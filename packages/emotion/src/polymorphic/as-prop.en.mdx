JSXCSS provides an as prop to convert any component to another html tag.

### accessibility

However, you can always convert it to another ReactElement if you wish.

```tsx
// Accessible
const Correct = () => <Box as="section" />
```

### type safety

You can freely change the tag while also being guaranteed stability in terms of type.

```tsx
// Wrong
const Wrong = () => (
  <Box
    as="div"
    href="https://example.com" // type error occurred! because of as prop, div tag have no href prop
  />
)

// Correct
const Correct = () => (
  <Box
    as="a"
    href="https://example.com" // Good, because of as prop, a tag
  />
)
```

### Integration with other libraries

By integrating with other html tags as well as other animation libraries, more functions can be combined with JSXCSS components.
